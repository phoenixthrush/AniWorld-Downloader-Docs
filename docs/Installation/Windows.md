# Windows

## Prerequisites

Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can verify this by opening the Terminal and running the command `python -v`. If Python is installed and the version is 3.9 or newer, you're all set.

You can download the latest Python installer by selecting "Windows installer (64-bit)" from the official [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/latest/).

:::tip[My tip]

If you're using an ARM-based system, you might encounter issues with the `curses` module. To address this, consider installing the AMD64 version of Python instead of the ARM version.
